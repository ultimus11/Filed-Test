# Filed-Test
Coding Exercise: Write a Flask / FastAPI / Django Web API that simulates the behavior of an audio file  server while using a MongoDB / SQL database. 

# Milestones Achieved 
## Starting With Models
> ParticipantField(models.Field)

Created Custom Model Field satisfying Podcast Participants requirement.
As recommended for podcasts there needs a list field which accepts 10 elements where each element has max size 100.
##### Use in model:
> participents = ParticipantField()

Other Model field achievements:
```
Datetime, cannot be in the past
string, cannot be larger than 100 characters
Duration in number of seconds â€“ (mandatory, integer, positive)
Participants field set to optional and others to mandatory fields
```
## Only Four Endpoints : Create, Delete, Update, Get 
Following requirements are satisfied.
> Create only four endpoints (make them generic and usable for all audio file types, do not create four endpoints for each of them)
> Use SOLID principles. 
> The classes should be written in such a way that they are easy to test. 
> Use design patterns where you find it suitable

I had performed many tests with Postman also i have written few tests in python program available at `https://github.com/ultimus11/Filed-Test/blob/main/filedTest/test.py`

I had used some URL manipulations Hence I had `tested some URL injection payloads with the help of Burp Suit` for purposes like Redirections and othe cyber attacks.
Endpoints in urls.py looks like
```
urlpatterns = [
    url('GET/', GETAPIView.as_view()),
    url('CREATE/', CREATEAPIView.as_view()),
    url('UPDATE/', UPDATEAPIView.as_view()),
    url('DELETE/', DELETEAPIView.as_view()),
]
```
`The list view and the detailed list view are both handled by GET/ endpoint.`
All endpoints strictly follow given design and routs recommendations for API.
The response of these methods should be one of the following:
- Action is successful: 200 OK 
- The request is invalid: 400 bad request 
- Any error: 500 internal server error 
## Technologies Used/Implemented
- Django Web API
- MongoDB
# How to Use:
### Requirements:
- Python 3.6.5 (Others versions will also work I tested it on 3.6.5)
- Django: pip install Django
- djongo: pip install djongo
- django rest framework: pip install djangorestframework
- MongoDB (Compass optional)
- Will power & dedication to solve the erors (optional: because its easy)
### Initial Steps
- clone this repo
- open cmd/terminal in filedTest directory
- open mongoDB compass and connect
- create database named `filedDb`
- run in terminal `py manage.py makemigrations`
- run in terminal `py manage.py migrate`
- run in terminal `py manage.py createsuperuser`
- give required credentials & set strong password for superuser
- run in terminal `py manage.py runserver`
- Access browsable api via localhost
